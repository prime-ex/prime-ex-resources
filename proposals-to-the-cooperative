Proposals to the Cooperative

The Prime-Ex Perpetual real estate ecosystem has been created specifically to allow people to participate in the formation, direction, and disruptive changes that will occur in real estate ecosystems both within our own ecosystem and other ecosystems that Prime-Ex Perpetual may influence with time.  
This participation includes the ability to make proposals to the Prime-Ex cooperative in meaningful ways that impact the experience of all the people within the cooperative.   
For example, a person may have a proposal that seeks to better streamline some specific process within the cooperative that produces a favorable impact on efficiency and enjoyment of the cooperative.  
A person that wants to make a proposal to the cooperative shall make the proposal to the cooperative via the blockchain for monthly consideration by the XP voters.  
The submitted proposal should describe how the proposal makes a positive impact on the cooperative in form and function, who the service provider of the proposal is along with their CV and any credentials that are relevant specific to the proposal, how much PEX and the terms in which the PEX may be paid in return for the proposal to be completed, and how much time the proposal is tendered to the cooperative for possible engagement.  
Persons whose proposals are accepted by the cooperative become a service provider to the cooperative and shall be paid for their services in PEX tokens in an amount that is agreeable to the cooperative within the timeframe that is acceptable to the service provider upon completion of their contract.
