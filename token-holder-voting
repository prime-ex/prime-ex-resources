Participants within the Prime-Ex real estate ecosystem direct the decisions of the cooperative monthly by exercising their voting rights they have accumulated by their historical XP aquisitions.  
The sum total of voting rights equal the sum total of historical XP allocated from Prime-Ex Perpetual to the PEX lCO participants and Service Providers.  
Unvoted XP shall pass along as executable by the Prime-Ex Administrator in the form of a Proxy Vote on a 1:1 basis.  
For example, if a given proposal has 25,000 XP that remains unvoted, then the Prime-Ex Administrator may execute a vote in favor of or against the proposal in the amount of 25,000 by proxy.
