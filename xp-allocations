XP allocations drive the decision making participation within the Prime-Ex Perpetual cooperative.  
XP tokens have no monetary value and cannot be transferred upon aquisition.  
XP tokens are generated in two ways.  
The first way is through the purchase of PEX tokens via the PEX lCO.  
Each PEX lCO token comes with a cooresponding XP token on a 100:1 basis.  
To wit, each PEX lCO participant that purchases 100 PEX tokens or greater shall receive 1 permanent, non-transferrable XP token for every 100 PEX purchased.  
The second way is by providing services to the Prime-Ex Perpetual ecosystem.  
Service Providers are paid for their services with PEX tokens.  
Service Providers shall receive XP by multiplying the number of PEX tokens received for their provided services by the closing PM price of Gold as priced in US Dollars as published on the London Bullion Market Association as of the date that the PEX tokens are paid divided by 1,000.  
This is not to be construed as to applying a dollar value for PEX tokens themselves.  
lt is meant to simply be a way to fairly distribute XP in a way that is fair to both the historical holders of XP as well as the recipients of the new XP as they qualify.  
lf we assume that the price of Gold closes at $1,625.14 on the date that 500 PEX is paid to a service provider, then the service provider shall be credited with 812.57 XP tokens as calculated by 500 X 1625.14 / 1000.
